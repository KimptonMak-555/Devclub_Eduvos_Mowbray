                    "Coding coding… it really is quite the up and down journey, sometimes it
                    works, other times it doesn't and you just don't know why (in either scenario
                    sometimes even). Ever since I started though, I never cared about coding
                    with other people, until I finally did, this wa in highschol however and wasn't
                    really a club. it was an IT class which we had once or twice a week after
                    school, a legitimate subject. Kinda ruined it a bit, but also brought me the
                    experience of working with and alongside other people who like to code.
                    Nothing special but that's pretty much the reason I want to have this club
                    going. To experience that again, a space where I can code with and
                    alongside other people who like to code, where I can grow with them in
                    terms of coding as we become better at this little thing we do. A space where
                    we can struggle to understand, laugh and march forward!
