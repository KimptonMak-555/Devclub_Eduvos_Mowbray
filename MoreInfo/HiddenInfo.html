        "Coding coding… it really is quite the up and down journey, sometimes it
        works, other times it doesn't and you just don't know why (in either scenario
        sometimes even). Ever since I started though, I never cared about coding
        with other people, until I finally did, this wa in highschol however and wasn't
        really a club. it was an IT class which we had once or twice a week after
        school, a legitimate subject. Kinda ruined it a bit, but also brought me the
        experience of working with and alongside other people who like to code.
        Nothing special but that's pretty much the reason I want to have this club
        going. To experience that again, a space where I can code with and
        alongside other people who like to code, where I can grow with them in
        terms of coding as we become better at this little thing we do. A space where
        we can struggle to understand, laugh and march forward!
