The skeleton will show how and what we plan to have the layout but only in written form. 
A separate file will hold the actual design/ designs to make it easy when doing the actual code. 
Feel free to expand in the skeleton how you wish the pages to be in terms of any animation or anything which the static images within the design may not be able to show.
